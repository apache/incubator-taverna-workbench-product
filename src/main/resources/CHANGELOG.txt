Changes in Taverna 2.5.0
========================

Taverna 2.5.0 includes several improvements, including additional
functionality (interaction service, PROV support, components),  
a simplified installation, user interface improvements
and bug-fixes.


Installation
------------
To simplify installation on common operating systems, Taverna
distributions for Windows/Linux/OSX now come bundled with
the corresponding JRE from OpenJDK and the required Graphviz
binaries. This JRE does no longer require the user to install 
the JCE Strong Encryption policy.

Note that installation on OS X currently requires the 
XQuartz libraries to be manually installed. 
XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg (or newer) should be included on the
Taverna OS X disk image. If not, see 
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/


Available services
------------------

To improve start-up time and simplify Taverna for
users in a wide range of scientific fields, 
Available Services no longer list bioinformatics services
such as BioMoby, Soaplab and BioMart by default. These
can be added by clicking Add Services.

TODO: is this how they can be re-enabled?


Interaction service
-------------------
The Interaction Service has been added to the Workbench. This
provides the ability to ask questions and inform users during
the running of the workflow. Unlike the previous interactive
local workers, this service uses an embedded web server, and 
therefore also works if using the Command Line tool or the 
Taverna Server.  

For details, see 
http://www.taverna.org.uk/developers/work-in-progress/interaction/

Provenance
----------
The Taverna-PROV export has been added. This adds a new
button "Save Provenance Bundle" when clicking "Save All"
from the results perspective. 

The provenance Data Bundle is a ZIP file based on the 
Research Object Bundle specification, and contains
a W3C PROV-O provenance of a workflow
run, in addition to all input, output and intermediate values
as separate files withint he bundle.

For details, see https://github.com/myGrid/taverna-prov


Component service
-----------------
The Component capability has been added. This allows the
usage of component services, which encapsulate a 
nested Taverna workflow that has been constructed and
described for compatiblity with other components within
a chosen Component Family.

This allows for publication of reusable workflow fragments,
which appear as single services within the master workflow. Unlike
nested workflows, components are retrieved at runtime from the
Component repository (by default myExperiment), allowing for
automatic updates. 

Components are defined according to a specified profile, to
ensure they comply with the specified interface and has
the required metadata (such as typing of inputs and outputs)
specified.

Available components are discovered within the chosen
component family, identifying compatible steps that 
can be combined in the master workflow without requiring any
adaptation with shim-services.

For details, see 
http://www.taverna.org.uk/developers/work-in-progress/components/


Help
----
Added Help->About, which includes debug information that 
can be posted with support requests. (T3-1015)



Credential Manager 
-------------------
Rather than requiring a credential manager password at start-up, 
the default password "taverna" is used unless manually specified. (T3-981)

The bundled OpenJDK includes support for strong cryptography, and thus
the JCE dialogue should no longer appear at startup. (T3-980)


XPath service
-------------
Added ability to extract the first matching value (at depth 0). 
Additional output ports added. (T3-1019)

Added ability to receive result of XPath functions, e.g.
"count(/foo/bar)" (T3-996)


REST service
------------

if experiencing network issues while loading
Available Services. (T3-1018)


Run dialog
----------

behind the workbench window if it was iconified (T2-2105, T3-994)


Workflow engine
---------------

(T2-1185, T2-1333)

Using myExperiment perspective could break display of Service Details
and other HTML-based components. (T2-1377)


API changes
-----------

Changes in Taverna 2.1.0 (since 2.1 beta 2)
===========================================

For a complete list of issues solved for 2.1.0, see
http://tinyurl.com/t2-1-0-fixes or
http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10040&resolution=1&resolution=11&fixfor=10112&fixfor=10131&sorter/field=issuekey&sorter/order=DESC


General user interface
----------------------
Keyboard shortcuts: There are now keyboard shortcuts for many of the
common workflow editing and running tasks.

Recent workflows: Taverna now remembers your recently edited workflows
and you can easily open them.

Notification of updates: Users are now notified when updates to Taverna
or to a plugin are available.


Editing of workflows
--------------------
Importation of workflows: You now have the ability to merge a workflow
into a currently edited workflow.

Animated diagram: The diagram can now be made animated so it is easier
to see what changes are being made.

Diagram problems: The workflow diagram will no longer throw exceptions
and refuse to display some workflows.

Iteration strategy: The iteration strategy of services in Taverna 1
workflows is now interpreted correctly within Taverna.

Customized looping: Customized loop conditions are now displayed and
saved correctly.

Copy/cut/paste: You can copy/cut and then paste services.  This allows
you to copy services from one workflow to another or within the same
workflow.


Services
--------
Support for security: secured WSDL services can now be called using
security validated via a credential manager.

Updated R support: the R service now allows connections to an Rserve for
the latest R (up to 2.10).

New spreadsheet service: you can import Excel or csv spreadsheets and
feed the content into your workflow.

Biomoby services: The BioMoby objects are now shown in the normal
service panel and can be added to the workflow just as other services.


Running of workflows
--------------------
Improved run dialog: The dialog for entering run values now copes with
complex trees of values.

Saving and reusing values: You can now save and reuse the input values
for a workflow run.  You can save the output values from a run and could
    use them as inputs for other workflow runs.

Output value display: Output values are displayed using the correct
renderers.  You are now warned if a value is large and could cause
problems for Taverna.

Output value tree: The tree of output values should now be correct.  It
no longer misses some of the generated data.

Runs: You can now access the data associated with previous runs.  The
provenance and data from a run can be deleted.

Workflow completion: Taverna now correctly detects when a workflow run
has finished.

Provenance and data management: The provenance is now kept in the same
database as the values.

Improved performance: Workflow execution in 2.1 RC 1 is faster than that
in 2.1 beta 2.
