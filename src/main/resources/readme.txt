Taverna requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 5 or 6 from Sun. No other versions of Java have been tested. Some Operating Systems, such as Ubuntu come with the Gnu GCJ version of Java that cannot be used to run Taverna. To download Sun Java 6 for Ubuntu start a Terminal, type the following:

sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

and follow the instructions.

You can also use the graphical package manager.
