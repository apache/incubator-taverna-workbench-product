============================
Taverna workbench 2.1 beta 2
============================


Taverna and Java
================

Taverna requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 5 or 6 from Sun. 
No other versions of Java have been tested.  You can download Sun's Java
from:
  http://www.java.com/getjava/


Java on Linux
-------------

Some Operating Systems, such as Ubuntu, come with the Gnu GCJ version of 
Java that cannot be used to run Taverna due to bugs in GCJ. 

To download Sun Java 6 for Ubuntu,  start a Terminal, type the following:

  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

and follow the instructions.

Read http://www.taverna.org.uk/taverna-requirements/ for more details
on Taverna's requirements, in particular how, if necessary, to set the
dot location.
