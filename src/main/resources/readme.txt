Taverna requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 5 or 6 from Sun. 
No other versions of Java have been tested. 

Some Operating Systems, such as Ubuntu come with the Gnu GCJ version of Java 
that cannot be used to run Taverna. To download Sun Java 6 for Ubuntu 
start a Terminal, type the following:

  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

and follow the instructions.

Read http://www.taverna.org.uk/taverna-requirements/ for more details
on Taverna's requirements, in particular how, if necessary, to set the
dot location.

See the release-notes.txt for details of changes in this version of
Taverna and known-issues.txt for known problems.

Example workflows can be found in the examples sub-directory.
