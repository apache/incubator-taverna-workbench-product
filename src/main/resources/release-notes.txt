Changes since 2.1 beta 2
========================

General user interface
======================

Keyboard shortcuts: There are now keyboard shortcuts for many of the
common workflow editing and running tasks.

Recent workflows: Taverna now remembers your recently edited workflows
and you can easily open them.

Notification of updates: Users are now notified when updates to
Taverna or to a plugin are available.

Editing of workflows
====================

Importation of workflows: You now have the ability to merge a workflow
into a currently edited workflow.

Animated diagram: The diagram can now be made animated so it is easier
to see what changes are being made.

Diagram problems: The workflow diagram will no longer throw exceptions
and refuse to display some workflows.

Iteration strategy: The iteration strategy of services in Taverna 1
workflows is now interpreted correctly within Taverna.

Customized looping: Customized loop conditions are now displayed and
saved correctly.

Copy/cut/paste: You can copy/cut and then paste services.  This allows
you to copy services from one workflow to another or within the same
workflow.

Services
========

Support for security: secured WSDL services can now be called using
security validated via a credential manager.

Updated R support: the R service now allows connections to an Rserve
for the latest R (up to 2.10).

New spreadsheet service: you can import Excel or csv spreadsheets and
feed the content into your workflow.

Biomoby services: The BioMoby objects are now shown in the normal
service panel and can be added to the workflow just as other services.

Running of workflows
====================

Improved run dialog: The dialog for entering run values now copes with
complex trees of values.

Saving and reusing values: You can now save and reuse the input values
for a workflow run.  You can save the output values from a run and
could use them as inputs for other workflow runs.

Output value display: Output values are displayed using the correct
renderers.  You are now warned if a value is large and could cause
problems for Taverna.

Output value tree: The tree of output values should now be correct.
It no longer misses some of the generated data.

Runs: You can now access the data associated with previous runs.  The
provenance and data from a run can be deleted.

Workflow completion: Taverna now correctly detects when a workflow run
has finished.

Provenance and data management: The provenance is now kept in the same
database as the values.

Improved performance: Workflow execution in 2.1 RC 1 is faster than
that in 2.1 beta 2.

myExperiment perspective
========================

Users can now
	- browse workflows on myExperiment
	- open a workflow from myExperiment in Taverna
	- merge a workflow from myExperiment into the current
workflow
	- upload a workflow from Taverna to myExperiment
	- download a workflow from myExperiment
